# Python Scripts for System and Cloud Management

This repository contains various Python scripts for managing systems and cloud resources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python 3. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* You have a basic understanding of Python and how to run Python scripts.

If the script uses external libraries, you will need to install them. For example, for scripts that interact with PostgreSQL, you will need the `psycopg2` library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install psycopg2
```
For scripts that interact with Docker, you need to have Docker installed on your system.

For scripts that interact with Cloudflare via flarectl, you need to install and configure flarectl. You can find instructions here.

## Using The Scripts
To use the scripts, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the script you want to run.
Run the script using Python. For example, python my_script.py.
Each script is standalone and can be run independently of the others.
