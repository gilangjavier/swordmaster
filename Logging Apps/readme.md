# Node.js and Go Application Logging Examples

This repository showcases various examples of logging in a Node.js and Go applications using different libraries and the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) logging format.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have a working Node.js and Go environment. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and Go from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
* You have a basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.js, Go and how to write and run applications in these languages.
* You are familiar with logging concepts and understand the importance of logging in software applications.

## Using The Examples

To use the examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the example you want to run.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` for Node.js examples and `go get` for Go examples.
4. Run the example. For Node.js examples use `npm start` and for Go examples use `go run main.go`. Each example is standalone and can be run independently of the others.

Each example illustrates the use of a different logging level: info, warn, debug, and error. The logs generated by each example follow the ECS format and can be easily integrated with the Elastic Stack for monitoring and analysis.
